# Banknote Contour

A simple java project that draws rectangles around currency banknotes for an input image.

##  Motivation

There are handful of applications and research papers about banknote detection using smart phones.
It can be used to aid people with vision impairment to recognize the currency in hand by using the smart phone camera.
The camera captures frames containing the currency, then a sound is played based on the currency value.

One of the basic steps for identification is to extract the part that contains the banknote and remove the background.
This can be done by color texture, or shape. This project focuses on extracting the banknote from the background by shape.
